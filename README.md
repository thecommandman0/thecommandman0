- 👋 Hi, I’m @thecommandman0
- 👀 I’m interested in comptuters, programming, and Minecraft. (And by extension, Minecraft mods.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in HTML (I would've perferred Java but it wasn't my choice.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn Minecraft modding.
- 📫 How to reach me: jefferieskellan9@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Whatever, as long as it's not female.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've made some balanced (in my opinion) RFTools dimlets. If you need me to make you some, hit me up.
